>> Handwritten character display using tensorflow

>> Observation
This project implements manual character recognition patterns using TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset. The objective is to recognize and classify handwritten characters (from 0 to 9) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

>> features
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition.
- Training of the MNIST dataset.
- Assessment of model accuracy on the test data set.
- Used to capture model forecasts with real lines.

>> Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Using Python
- TensorWaterfall
- The Matplotlib
